## **Base Price/Gross Price**

Base price:-  Price without any additional charges (pre-tax).
Gross price:-  Final price including taxes, fees, etc. (post-tax).

``` formula
GM = Qty * price per item
```

Example :- 30 $

## **Pre_invoice deductions**
-	Usually it is in %.
Yearly discount agreement made at the beginning of the fic year.
Example : 2 $
```
formula
 Net invoice Sales =  Gross price - pre-invoice deduction
30$		     - 2$			       = 28$ 
```

Offers:

1)	Promotional offers : let say any festival  example diwali  and dussehra, then Atliq provide some offers to the customer called promotional offers.

2)	Placement fee :- let say if the Atliq informs the customer to place their products in the prime location for more attraction then they will provide some discount or fee for the maintenance called placement fee.

3)	Performance Rebate :-  let say the particular customer does huge sales to the unit then they provide some offers called performance Rebate.


## **Post - invoice deductions** 

includes :- offers + fee + rebate
Example :- 3 $ ( mostly it is in %).
Net Invoice Sales - Post - invoice deductions = Net Sales.
28 $                         -   3 $                                    = 25 $

```formlula
post invoice amount = Net invoice sales * post invoice pct
```
 
## **Net Sales**

Net sales refers to the total revenue from sales after deducting.

```formlula
Net Sales=Gross Sales − Returns − Allowances − Discounts
```

## **Cogs**
( Manufacturing cost + Transportation cost( freight cost ) + other cost ) = 20 $

1) Their might be 10 to 15 costs are associated with cogs
2) COGS is subtracted from net sales to calculate the gross profit,

```formula

 Net Sales * freight _ Pct = freight cost
 Net_sales * other freight _pct = other freight cost
```

## **Gross Margin**
1) % of revenue retained by the company after the deductions.
2) is often used to evaluate profitability.
```formula
	NET SALES - COGS = GROSS MARGIN (PROFIT)

Example :- 
	25 $                -  20 $ =  5$
	
	Gross margin %of net sales ( GM / NS ) :-

	(( Net sales - cogs ) / net sales )*100) 
	
	((25 - 20 ) / 25 )*100) = 20

```
## **operational cost**
	Operational cost :-  Net sales * operational _pct = operational amount (ass , papers)
	Operational other pct : Net sales * operational _pct = operational amount ( current bill, rent and so)

 ``` formula
Net sales * operational _pct =operational cost 
```
## **Net Profit**
	Operational cost :-  Net sales * operational _pct = operational amount (ass , papers)
	Operational other pct : Net sales * operational _pct = operational amount ( current bill, rent and so)
```formula
	Gross Margin - ( operational cost ) = Net Profit
```
## **Net profit %**
``` formula
NP % = (NP / NS )*100
```
